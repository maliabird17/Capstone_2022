### processing_gut

Raw data corresponds to normalized microarray expression data across all probes. 

Four files are included in the folder, corresponding to expression level in the named
organ and one file with expression across all organs: 

 1. Madalena_microarraysExpression_gut: Gut data
 
 2. Madalena_microarraysExpression_muscle: Muscle data 
 
 3. Madalena_microarraysExpression_testes: Testes data
 
 4. Madalena_microarraysExpression2
 
    - Question: Are organ expression levels already relative to each other or analyzed separately?
